The first and foremost step will be to collect data in order to formulate a model. For this we will use the Breast Cancer 
patients'data of Wisconsin city. This was collected from the radiology and cancer detection centres of various hospitals
spread across the city of Wisconsin. This will be a csv file containing different attributes which may or may not be used 
to train the model. These attributes are the independent variable based on which we need to model the probability of it 
growing into a cancer. It contains various attributes such as clump thickness, cell size, cell shape, marginal adhesion, 
bland chromatin, etc which will be used to pedict tha cancer and the relation between the attributes and its weightage 
will also be visualized, analyzed and studied. We will also use two models- KNN and SVM and compare the two models. We can 
find that most of the observations are good to train and test the machine learning model. There are some unbalanced labels 
which needs to be balanced in order to create an unbiased ML model.
