The first and foremost step will be to collect data in order to formulate a model. For this we will use the data of Seattle 
city. This will be a csv file containing different attributes which may or may not be used to train the model. These 
attributes are the independent variable based on which we need to model the severity of accidents. It contains attributes 
such as road condition, weather which mights have an impact on the severity which can be later on visualized and analyzed.
We can find that most of the observations are good to train and test the machine learning model. There are some unbalanced
labels which needs to be baanced in order to create an unbiased ML model.
